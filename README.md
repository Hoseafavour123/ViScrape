# ViScrape - An AI-powered visual web scraper[ViScrape_README.md](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22560445/ViScrape_README.md)

**Tagline:** Build reliable web scraping workflows visually — AI assists selectors, transforms, and recovery so non-developers move from idea → data, and engineers scale with confidence.

---

## One-line elevator pitch
Visual, AI-assisted web scraping for analysts and engineers: design extraction flows via drag‑and‑drop while an LLM suggests selectors, normalizes outputs, and reduces brittle, hand‑coded scrapers.

---

## Why this project matters (for hiring managers)
- **Bridges product and engineering**: Turns a traditionally developer-only capability into a visual product used by non-technical teams — showing product thinking and UX empathy.
- **Applied AI for practical automation**: Demonstrates thoughtful integration of LLMs to reduce manual work (selector suggestion, schema inference, recovery), not just “AI for the sake of AI”.
- **End-to-end engineering**: Illustrates full-stack design — frontend UX, backend orchestration, scraper adapters, persistence, and observability.
- **Real-world constraints considered**: Rate limits, anti‑scraping defenses, sandboxed transforms, and cost/resource trade-offs are addressed.

---

## Key features & impact (quick bullets recruiters love)
- **Drag‑and‑drop workflow canvas** — non-developers can assemble navigation, extract, transform and store nodes.
- **LLM‑assisted selector & schema suggestions** — reduces manual selector crafting by up to **X×** (replace with your measured metric).
- **Hybrid scraping engine** — Cheerio for speed, headless browser (Playwright/Puppeteer) for JS-heavy pages.
- **Extensible adapters & plugins** — add custom extractors, model backends, storage sinks.
- **Job orchestration & retries** — queues, rate‑limits, and retry policies to run workflows reliably at scale.
- **Persistence & reproducibility** — workflow DSL (JSON), versioned workflows, and run artifacts for audits/debugging.

---

## Architecture & rationale (concise)
```
Browser (Next.js/React UI)
  └─ Visual canvas → Workflow JSON
Server (Node API + Orchestrator)
  ├─ Job Queue (Redis)
  ├─ Scraper Adapters: Headless Browser / HTTP+Cheerio / API
  ├─ AI Backend: OpenAI (or configurable LLM)
  └─ Storage: CSV / Postgres (Prisma) / Webhooks
```

**Why these choices**
- **Next.js** — fast developer DX, server/client routes for UI + API.
- **Prisma** — explicit schema migrations for workflows and run history.
- **Headless browser + Cheerio** — best-of-both: speed when possible, full rendering when required.
- **Job queue** — decouples UI actions from heavy runs; enables retries, concurrency control and observability.
- **Pluggable LLM backend** — avoids vendor lock‑in and supports local/private models for enterprise settings.

## Short example: workflow DSL (what to show a tech lead)
```json
{
  "name": "product-price",
  "nodes":[
    {"id":"n1","type":"navigate","url":"https://example.com/category"},
    {"id":"n2","type":"extract","selector":".product-item","output":"items"},
    {"id":"n3","type":"loop","itemsRef":"items"},
    {"id":"n4","type":"extract","selector":".price","context":"n3","output":"price"},
    {"id":"n5","type":"transform","fn":"parseFloat","input":"price","output":"priceNum"},
    {"id":"n6","type":"store","target":"csv","path":"./out/prices.csv"}
  ]
}
```
> Talk track: highlight the JSON DSL, how nodes compose into repeatable, versioned pipelines and how transforms are sandboxed for safety.

## Quickstart (one paragraph for hiring managers)
Run locally to demo in 5–10 minutes:
1. `git clone https://github.com/Hoseafavour123/ViScrape.git && cd ViScrape`  
2. `npm install`  
3. Copy `.env.example` → `.env` (set `DATABASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` or model config).  
4. `npx prisma migrate dev --name init && npm run dev`  
Open `http://localhost:3000`. Be prepared to demonstrate: create a simple navigate→extract→store workflow, run it, and show the inspector logs & CSV output.

---

## What to demo live (high‑impact checklist)
- Drag an **Extract** node, accept an **LLM selector suggestion**, and show the element highlighted in the preview.
- Run a workflow and show a **sample run artifact** (previewed rows + stored CSV or DB entry).
- Show a failing selector → demonstrate **LLM‑assisted recovery** or manual override.
- Inspect orchestration: job run history, retry, and logs — explain trade‑offs in concurrency and costs.

---

## Internals & extensibility (topics engineers will probe)
- **Workflow DSL** (JSON) — serializable, diffable, versionable.
- **Adapters** — implement `ExtractorAdapter` interface to add Playwright, HTTP, or API extractors.
- **Transform sandboxing** — transforms execute in a restricted runtime (explain approach: VM/WASM, timeouts, memory limits).
- **AI integration** — prompt design for selector suggestion, temperature control, fallback heuristics; metrics for suggestion accuracy.
- **Observability** — per‑run logs, sample payloads, run metrics for SLA and debugging.

---

## Limitations & trade-offs (be honest — impresses technical interviewers)
- LLM suggestions are heuristic — always validate selectors before production runs.
- CAPTCHAs / aggressive bot defenses require additional infrastructure (proxies, human-in-loop).
- Running many headless browsers incurs costs — trade-offs between speed (browser) and throughput (HTTP parsing).
- Legal/ethical constraints: must respect `robots.txt` and site terms — include compliance checks.

---

## Roadmap (signals product & scalability thinking)
- Interactive step‑through debugger (highlight element per node).
- Proxy manager and CAPTCHA orchestration.
- Enterprise features: multi-tenant, RBAC, audit logs, SSO.
- Plugin marketplace: community adapters & transforms.
- Offline/local LLM option for privacy-sensitive customers.

## How to talk about ViScrape in interviews — a cheat sheet (very high ROI)
When asked, structure your response:
1. **Problem → Impact**: "Scraping is brittle and engineering‑heavy; ViScrape reduced hand‑coded extractor time and enabled non-dev analysts to self-serve."
2. **Design decisions & trade-offs**: explain why JSON DSL, why mix headless + static parsing, and why a job queue (decoupling).
3. **AI integration detail**: show prompt examples, metric for selector accuracy, and fallback logic — explain cost/latency trade-offs.
4. **Scaling & reliability**: describe concurrency limits, retry/backoff strategy, observability, and how you'd scale to thousands of concurrent workflows.
5. **Security & ethics**: describe sandboxing, secret management, and policy to respect `robots.txt` and rate limits.
6. **Show code**: walk a small code sample (e.g., run loop or transform sandbox) and a test that validates selector extraction.
7. **Metrics**: if available, cite concrete numbers (time savings, number of workflows, success rate). If not, state how you'd measure success.

**Replace placeholders with real screenshots and metrics** to maximize impact. If you'd like, I can generate a production-ready one-page PDF summary or create the demo GIF and example workflows to include in `/examples` to make your project screening‑ready.
